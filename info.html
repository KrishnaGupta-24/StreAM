      <h2>üß† What is Stress?</h2>
      <p>Stress is the body's natural response to any demand or challenge, whether real or perceived. It is a psychological and physiological reaction that occurs when individuals feel they cannot cope with the pressures placed on them, leading to a state of heightened alertness and physical changes in the body. Stress can arise from various sources, such as work-related pressures, relationship issues, financial difficulties, or major life events like moving, illness, or loss.

      <h2>1Ô∏è‚É£ Physical Stress
      </h2>
      <p>Physical stress refers to the strain or pressure placed on the body as a result of various physical activities, environmental conditions, illnesses, or injuries. It occurs when the body is pushed beyond its normal limits, forcing it to work harder to maintain balance and functionality. Common causes of physical stress include intense exercise, heavy lifting, prolonged periods of physical labor, or even simple activities done without proper rest and recovery. Factors like lack of sleep, poor nutrition, dehydration, and exposure to extreme temperatures can further amplify physical stress.

      <h2>2Ô∏è‚É£ Behavioral Stress</h2>
      <p>Behavioral stress is a type of stress that affects a person‚Äôs actions and habits. It arises when individuals experience overwhelming pressure and struggle to cope with stressors in a healthy way. Instead of addressing the root cause of stress, the individual may engage in unhealthy or uncharacteristic behaviors, which may provide temporary relief but ultimately worsen the stress in the long run.

      <h2>3Ô∏è‚É£ Mental Stress 
      </h2>
      <p>Mental stress is a psychological strain that affects the way a person thinks, processes information, and reacts to daily challenges. It arises when an individual feels overwhelmed by external pressures such as academic demands, work responsibilities, relationship issues, or financial worries. Even perceived threats, not just real ones, can trigger mental stress, causing the brain to enter a state of heightened alertness or anxiety.

      </h2>
      <p>Emotional stress is a state of mental tension that arises from overwhelming emotions such as fear, sadness, anger, or frustration. It often occurs when individuals face difficult situations like relationship problems, grief, major life changes, or personal setbacks. Emotional stress affects mood and emotional stability, leading to intense feelings that are sometimes hard to control or understand.
